        <span>General Information:</span><br><br>
        Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is often referred to as the Earth's sister planet because it is similar in size and composition. However, despite these similarities, Venus has a vastly different atmosphere and surface environment compared to Earth. In this article, we will discuss the various aspects of Venus, including its characteristics, composition, atmosphere, surface features, and exploration history.<br><br>

        <span>Characteristics of Venus:</span><br><br>

        Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is the sixth largest planet in the Solar System. It has a diameter of approximately 12,104 kilometers (7,521 miles), which is about 95% of the Earth's diameter. Venus has a dense atmosphere and rotates in the opposite direction to most planets, which means that its day is longer than its year. A day on Venus lasts about 243 Earth days, while a year on Venus lasts about 225 Earth days. <br><br>

        <span>Composition of Venus: </span><br><br>

        Venus is a rocky planet with a composition similar to that of the Earth. It has a metal core, a silicate mantle, and a thin crust. However, unlike the Earth, Venus has no magnetic field, which means that it is exposed to harsh solar winds that strip away its atmosphere. <br><br>

        <span>Atmosphere of Venus: </span><br><br>

        Venus has a thick atmosphere that is primarily composed of carbon dioxide (96.5%) with trace amounts of nitrogen and other gases. The thick atmosphere of Venus creates a greenhouse effect that traps heat, making the planet's surface temperature the hottest in the Solar System. Venus has an average surface temperature of about 464 degrees Celsius (867 degrees Fahrenheit), which is hotter than the surface of Venus, the closest planet to the Sun. <br><br>

        <span>Surface Features of Venus: </span><br><br>

        Venus' surface is characterized by vast plains, highland regions, and numerous volcanoes. The planet's surface is covered in a thick layer of volcanic rock, and there are more than 1,000 volcanoes that have been identified. Some of these volcanoes are active, and they produce lava flows and sulfur dioxide emissions that can be detected from space. Venus also has several impact craters, but these are relatively rare due to the planet's dense atmosphere, which burns up most meteoroids before they can reach the surface. <br><br>

        <span> Exploration History of Venus: </span><br><br>

        Venus has been studied extensively by spacecraft and telescopes. The first spacecraft to visit Venus was NASA's Mariner 2, which flew by the planet in 1962. Since then, many other spacecraft have been sent to study Venus, including the Soviet Venera and Vega missions, as well as NASA's Magellan mission. <br><br>

        The Venera and Vega missions were the first to land on Venus and provided the first images of the planet's surface. The images showed a barren, volcanic landscape with no signs of life. <br><br>

        NASA's Magellan mission arrived at Venus in 1990 and mapped 98% of the planet's surface using radar. The mission revealed that Venus has a complex geologic history, with evidence of tectonic activity, lava flows, and impact craters. The Magellan mission also provided new insights into Venus' atmosphere, including the discovery of lightning and the presence of a layer of sulfuric acid clouds.<br><br>

        In 2021, NASA announced the selection of two new missions to Venus: VERITAS (Venus Emissivity, Radio Science, InSAR, Topography, and Spectroscopy) and DAVINCI+ (Deep Atmosphere Venus Investigation of Noble gases, Chemistry, and Imaging). VERITAS will map the planet's surface and study its geologic history, while DAVINCI+ will explore the planet's atmosphere and look for signs of past or present life. <br><br>

        <span>Conclusion: </span><br><br>

        Venus is a fascinating planet that is similar to Earth in many ways but has a vastly different atmosphere and surface
